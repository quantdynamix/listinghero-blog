When selling on Amazon, your product images can make or break your success. With millions of products competing for customer attention, following Amazon's strict image guidelines isn't just recommended—it's essential for visibility, credibility, and sales performance.

Amazon's image requirements exist to create a consistent, professional shopping experience across the platform. Violating these guidelines can result in listing suppression, reduced search visibility, or even account penalties.

#### Why Amazon Image Guidelines Matter

Amazon's image guidelines serve multiple critical purposes:

* **Consistency**: Creates a uniform shopping experience across all product categories
* **Trust**: Professional images build customer confidence and reduce return rates
* **Search Performance**: Compliant images improve your product's visibility in search results
* **Conversion**: High-quality, guideline-compliant images directly impact purchase decisions
* **Account Health**: Following guidelines prevents listing issues and potential account penalties

Understanding and implementing these requirements is fundamental to Amazon selling success.

### Amazon Main Image Requirements: Complete Breakdown

Amazon's main image serves as the primary visual representation of your product across search results and product pages. Here are the detailed requirements every seller must follow:

---

### Image Quality and Accuracy

**Accurately represent the product** as a realistic, professional-quality image. The image must accurately represent the real scale, quantity, and color of the product.

#### Key Requirements:

* Use high-resolution, professional photography
* Ensure colors match the actual product
* Show accurate proportions and sizing
* Maintain consistent lighting and clarity

**No placeholders allowed**: Never use temporary placeholder images, as the first image uploaded defines the product identity. Using placeholders can cause your intended image to be blocked from upload.

---

### Background Requirements

**Pure white background mandatory** (RGB color values: 255, 255, 255) to create a consistent shopping experience across search and product detail pages.

#### Background Standards:

* Use exactly RGB 255, 255, 255 (pure white)
* Ensure seamless background with no shadows or gradients
* Remove all distracting elements from the background
* Maintain professional, clean appearance

*Note: Limited product types allow lifestyle images with no text or extra logos. Refer to Amazon's Product page style guide for specific exceptions.*

---

### Product Positioning and Size

**Show the product as 85% of the image** to ensure optimal visibility and impact.

#### Positioning Guidelines:

* Fill 85% of the image frame with your product
* Center the product within the frame
* Ensure adequate white space around the product
* Maintain proper aspect ratios

---

### Text and Graphics Restrictions

**No overlays permitted**: Absolutely no text, logos, borders, color blocks, watermarks, or other graphics covering the product or in the background.

#### Prohibited Elements:

* Text overlays or callouts
* Brand logos or watermarks
* Decorative borders or frames
* Color blocks or graphics
* Any visual elements that distract from the product

For products with multiple pieces, all components must be relative in size with no single piece enlarged disproportionately.

---

### Product Presentation Standards

**Show the entire product** within the frame without cutting off any parts.

#### Presentation Requirements:

* Display complete product view
* Avoid cropping any product elements
* Ensure all components are visible
* Maintain product integrity in the frame

**No accessories or props** that aren't included with purchase, as these might confuse customers about what they're actually buying.

---

### Single Product Display

**Show only one unit** of the product and any accessories included in the purchase.

#### Display Standards:

* Present single product view (e.g., front only, not front and back simultaneously)
* Include only items that come with purchase
* For multipacks or assortments, follow specific category guidance
* Avoid multiple product angles in main image

---

### Packaging Guidelines

**Exclude packaging** unless it's an important product feature.

#### Packaging Rules:

* Don't show retail packaging, boxes, or bags
* Exception: Include packaging if it's a key feature (carrying cases, gift baskets)
* Focus on the actual product customers will receive
* Remove all shipping materials from view

---

### Model and Display Restrictions

**No mannequins allowed** regardless of appearance—clear, solid-color, flesh-toned, framework, or hanging displays are all prohibited.

#### Model Guidelines:

* **Footwear**: Show single shoe, facing left, at 45-degree angle
* **Clothing accessories/multipacks**: Display flat without models
* **Adult clothing**: Show on standing models only (no sitting, kneeling, leaning, or lying down)
* **Inclusive representation**: Encourage diverse models and those using assistive technology like wheelchairs and prosthetics

---

### Category-Specific Requirements

Different product categories may have additional specific requirements:

#### Footwear:

* Single shoe display
* Left-facing orientation
* 45-degree angle positioning

#### Clothing:

* Adult sizes require live models
* Models must be standing upright
* No seated or reclining poses

#### Accessories:

* Flat lay presentation preferred
* No model interaction required

### Best Practices for Compliance

To ensure your images meet all requirements:

1. **Professional Photography**: Invest in high-quality product photography
2. **Consistent Lighting**: Use even, diffused lighting to eliminate shadows
3. **Color Accuracy**: Ensure colors match actual product appearance
4. **Background Removal**: Use professional editing to achieve pure white backgrounds
5. **Size Optimization**: Maintain 85% product fill while preserving image quality
6. **Quality Control**: Review all images against guidelines before upload

---

### Common Violations to Avoid

* Using lifestyle backgrounds instead of pure white
* Including promotional text or graphics
* Showing multiple product angles in one image
* Using mannequins or inappropriate model poses
* Cropping parts of the product
* Including non-included accessories or props
* Using low-resolution or blurry images
